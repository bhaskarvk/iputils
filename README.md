# iputils

R package containing utility functions to work with IP Addresses.

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bhaskarvk/iputils.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bhaskarvk/iputils)

**NOTE** This is in pure R and will not be as fast as [iptools](https://www.github.com/hrbrmstr/iptools)

This is primarily for teaching myself (Bhaskar V. K.) how to write R packages.
